name=DisconnectedRoadChecker
description=Identifies short, disconnected road segments - commonly referred to as disconnected islands - that are not properly connected to the rest of the road network.  
 Checks if segment endpoints lack nearby connections within a 0.5 meter buffer to detect topological errors or incomplete digitizations.
about=DisconnectedRoadChecker is a QGIS plugin designed to flag short road segments isolated from the main network.  
 It analyzes line geometries and checks if segment endpoints connect to other features within a 0.5 meter proximity.  
 Users can define a maximum allowed segment length (meters).  
 Results appear in an interactive dock with zoom and selection options.
